a. Data Cleaning

Covered: Yes, your notebook includes several data cleaning steps:
df = df.drop_duplicates(): Removal of duplicate rows.
df = df.drop(['AQI_Bucket'], axis=1): Dropping a column.
df.fillna(): Handling missing values (imputation with mode for categorical and mean for numerical columns).
Outlier Removal: You've defined a function remove_outliers and applied it to several numeric columns.
df = df.dropna(): Dropping rows with any remaining NaN values
df.columns = df.columns.str.strip().str.lower(): Cleaning column names

b. Data Integration
Covered: Yes, there is one instance of Data Integration.
concatenated_df = pd.concat([subSet1, subSet2], axis=1): This line concatenates two subsets of the DataFrame (subSet1 and subSet2) horizontally. This is a basic form of data integration.

c. Data Transformation
Covered: Yes, your notebook performs data transformation:
LabelEncoder(): Conversion of categorical variables ('City', 'Date') into numerical representations.
Outlier Removal: While also a cleaning step, removing outliers transforms the distribution of the data.

d. Error Correcting
Partially Covered:
Missing Value Imputation: Filling missing values can be seen as a form of error correction, as it addresses the error of having incomplete data.
Outlier Removal: Outliers can sometimes be erroneous data points, and removing them can be considered error correction.
However, your notebook doesn't include explicit steps to validate data against known rules or external sources, or to correct inconsistencies based on domain knowledge.
                                      
e. Data Model Building
Covered: Yes, the notebook includes building a Linear Regression model.
The code performs:
Data Splitting (train_test_split)
Model Training (model.fit())
Prediction (model.predict())
Evaluation (mean_squared_error, r2_score)
